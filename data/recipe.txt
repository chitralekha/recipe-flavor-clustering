This project uses the Food.com Recipes and Reviews dataset from Kaggle:

- [🍴 Food.com Recipes and Interactions Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions)

Due to GitHub's file size upload limits, the raw data files (`recipes.csv`, `reviews.csv`) are not included here.
